# Pacman Mojificado
Pacman Mojificado is an adapted version of classic game pacman for a project of "Fundamentos Lógicos de Inteligência Artificial" (FLIA) class of Universidade de Brasília (UnB). This class consists of modeling games and other challenges with PDDL, planning domain definition language, so students build codes that can solve the problem in question.

This Unity project consists of a tool for the students of FLIA 2024.2 class to preview maps that need to be solved and test their solution. They can put the map into the input field at the start of the game and play the game to see if their solution is correct, and to better visualize the output of their AI.
